abstract: Effective management of transmissible diseases in farmed prawns requires early detection and accurate diagnosis, yet clinical and contextual cues often appear only once outbreaks grow. Pond-side tests (PSTs) could shorten time-to-response but are restricted for notifiable diseases. Our systematic review identified 52 articles describing 94 detection protocols for white spot syndrome virus, of which 22 were farm-feasible. Evidence focused largely on developing new detection methods, but not much on the field diagnostic accuracy of available detection tests. PSTs appear valuable for early response and complementary to official diagnostic confirmatory tests but need stronger diagnostic accuracy evidence.
